Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of [insert number] rows of data, representing Amazon
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.

## Analysis Questions Resolved

During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:

## Analysis Questions Resolved
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:

1. what are the total sales made by each customer?

2. How many orders were placed in each state?

3. how many unique products were sold?

4. How many returns were made for each product category.

5. How many orders were placed in each month(2022)

6.  Determine the top 3 products whose revenue has decreased to the previous year?

7. List all orders where the quantity sold is greater than the average quantity sold across all orders

8. Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profit?

9. Find details of the top 5 products with the highest total sale, where the total sale for EACH
   products is greater than the avg sale across all products?

10. Identify the top 2 categories that have received maximum returns and their return
percentage.

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.

## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.

4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights.
5. Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer
preferences, and other factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analyzing the dataset
and addressing the key questions, we hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions
and optimizing their sales strategies.
